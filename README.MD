# ICT Conscript Admission Test

I have done the task 01b-swdev-backend-api.

The OpenAPI specification can be found in [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml), or my best interpetration of how it should be done.

My api can be reached via [https://test-ictconscript-admission-s8qs.onrender.com](https://test-ictconscript-admission-s8qs.onrender.com).

Unfortunetly I didn't complete any of the streach goals, because of my time constraints, though I know how they are done and I have done them in other projects.

I had trouble with this command `docker build . && docker run -p 8000:8000` to start the server, maybe because I used windows 11 for this, but I got it to work with this command `docker build -t test-ictconscript-admission . && docker run -p 8000:8000 -it test-ictconscript-admission`, just some naming of the image.
